# TOGAF Certification Exam Preparation Guide and Notes
Purpose: This document is created for preparation of TOGAF certification notes. This is done for self study, completeness and accuracy are not guaranteed.



# What is an architecture framework
1. A conceptual structure used to develop, implement, govern, and sustain an
architecture
2. Provides a practical starting point for an Architecture Project
3. It should describe a method for designing target state of the enterprise in
terms of a set of building blocks, and for showing how the building blocks
fit together

** Quick Summary: TOGAF Framework has 6 parts to it, and one of the is ADM. ADM by itself has Preliminary phase and Phases A to H.**

Each Phase will be learned in the next notes, every phase has its own Objectives, input, output and steps. This is what is usually referred in questions.

# ADM

1. Preliminary Phase : The goal is to prepare for creating Architecture Capability
2. Phase A Architecture Vision : Create statement of work, is a the beginning of an iteration, Sets Scope and expectations of Architecture process.
3. Phase B Business Architecture :  Indicate how business is organized, and how it connects to goals (sounds like fluff! this is mostly about as-is and to-be states). Contains roles, business processes,functions, services and links between functions. Steps 
4. Phase C Information Systems Architecture : Document Data and Application architecture for a project. Which of those architecture comes first depends on our scope.
5. Phase D Technology Architecture : Principles of design, evolution of an It System including hardware/software/integrations
6. Phase E Opportunities and Solutions :  Initial implementation planning, identify major projects, what kind of solutions can be made
7. Phase F Migration Planning : With output of E, plan for Implementation and Migration.
8. Phase G Implementation Governance : Provide architecture oversight for implementation, define architecture constraints for implementation, write Business Value realization
9. Phase H Architecture Change management :  Provide a monitoring and change management process, create a way on how architecture change will be done in future.

All this while, we continue to validate against requirements.

Now we go in depth of ADM, and start looking at those Phases in detail.
